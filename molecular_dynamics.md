# Molecular Dynamics
## Background
* In this lecture, we will see the molecular dynamics (MD) and how to do it with Gaussian.

## Computation
* Running AIMD with Gaussian is not impossible but its function is limited. *So I do not recommend use Gaussian for AIMD*.
* Here we will use *NWChem* instead.
