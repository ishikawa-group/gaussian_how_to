# Linux how to

## introduction
* In Linux, you should work with **terminal**, which is CUI (character user interface), a different interface from GUI (graphical user interface).
* The Gaussian is usually done in remote environment, because running Gaussian on your desktop/laptop is not a good idea since it demands large CPU power, memotry, and hardware in/out.
* Thus it is recommented to run the Gaussian on supercomputes. Here, we mainly use TSUBAME, a Tokyo-Tech supercomputer.
* The usage of TSUBAME is introduced later. First, we will look into the basic linux commands.

## basic linux commands
* `cd`: To change the current directory, `cd target_dir`. Note that `target_dir` should be a directory, not a file.
* `ls`: To list the files and directories in the current directory, you should `ls`.
* `cp`: To copy a file, you should `cp from_file to_file`.
* `pwd`: To display the current directory, type `pwd`.
* `less`: To see the contents of file. For files more than one page, place *space* key to see further. Type `q` to quit. If you type `shift + f`, it waits the reloading the file. This mode can be quited by `ctrl + c`.
* `grep`: To extract a line with some keyword, type `grep "keyword" filename`.
* `mkdir`: To make a new directory, type `mkdir new_dir`.

## editor
* There are several editors in linux. Two editors are popular, *vim* and *emacs*.
* To use vi, just type `vi target_file`.
* You can use these editors in the remote environment.
* If you do not want to use vi/emacs, *copy your target file to local PC and then use your favorite editor (like notepad), then send it back to remote environment*.

### vi usage
* 

## ssh
### key-generation
* `ssh-keygen`

### login
1. Login a portal site with your internet browser (Edge, Chrome, Safari etc.)
2. Click "ssh public key registration" (or similar contents).
3. Copy the public key file (id_rsa_XXX.pub) generated by ssh-keygen.
4. Paste the above contents to some appropriate space.
5. Go back to terminal and login via `ssh [your_account_name]@[login_node].ac.jp -i [your_private_keyfile]

### scp
* After making a ssh-login environment, you can use `scp` (means secure copy) to send/take file from/to remove environment.
    * send: `scp your_file login_node:directory`
    * take: `scp login_node:directory your_local_directory`

## submitting jobs
* pjsub?
