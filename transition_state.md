# Transition state
## Background 
* In this lecture, we will see how to locate the transition state (TS) with Gaussian.
* TS is the geometry connecting the reactant (before reaction) and the product system (after reaction).
* The energy difference between the reactant and the TS is called the *activation energy* (for forward direction).
* The energy difference of the product and the TS is also the activation energy, but for reverse direction.
* The energy difference of the reactant and product states is called the *reaction energy*.

## Computation
* Basically, the TS optimization needs the forace constant (Hessian) matrix.
* `opt=TS` will do the TS optimization.
* `calcFC`: Calculate the force constant before doing the TS calculation. Use like `opt(TS, calcFC)`
* `readFC`: Read the pre-calculated force constant. Use like `opt(TS, readFC)`
