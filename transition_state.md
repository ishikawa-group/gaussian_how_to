# Transition state
* In this lecture, we will see how to locate the transition state (TS) with Gaussian.
* TS is the geometry connecting the reactant (before reaction) and the product system (after reaction).
* The energy difference between the reactant and the TS is called the *activation energy* (for forward direction).
* The energy difference of the product and the TS is also the activation energy, but for reverse direction.
* The energy difference of the reactant and product states is called the *reaction energy*.
