# Geometry optimization
* In this lecture, we will see how to do the geometry optimization with Gaussian.
* Geometry here means the positions of nuclei in the molecule.
* The most stable positions of nuclei make the minimum of the total energy (electronic energy plus inter-nuclei repulsion) of the molecule.
* This is achirved, for example, changing the bond length of diatomic molecules.
* In the diatomic molecule, the relatinoship between coordinate and energy is called the *potential energy curve*.
* Geometry optimization is the procedure to find the energy minima in the potential energy curve.
