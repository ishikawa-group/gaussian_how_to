## Theoretical background
* The behavior of the particles is governed by the equation of motion, and its classical mechanical version is known as the Newton's law.
* The proper description of atoms, molecules, and electrons is given by the laws of quantum mechanics. For this reason, we need to consider the **Schr√∂dinger equation**, which is a quantum-mechanical equation of motion.
* If the solutions of the Schrodinger equations are generated without reference to experimental data, the methods are usually called "ab initio" (latin: "from the beginning") or "first principle".

## Hartree-Fock method
* The Hartree product obeys the Pauli' exclusion principle only to some extent; in the Hatree product wave function, each electronic state is occupied by one electron. However, it does not take into account the anti-symmetry character of the wave function.
* Mathemtatically, this requres that the sign of $\Psi$ changes when two electrons are exchanged.
* The requirement is overcome by using a detarminant. This is called a **Slater determinant**.
* The Slater determinant is constructed from the single-particle wave functions by

---

$$
\Psi({\bf r_1, r_2}\cdots {\bf r_N}) 
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
\begin{vmatrix}
\psi_1({\bf r_1}) & \cdots & \psi_1({\bf r_N}) \\
\vdots            & \ddots & \vdots \\
\psi_N({\bf r_1}) & \cdots & \psi_N({\bf r_N}) \\
\end{vmatrix}
$$

* Then the expectation value of the total energy becomes
$$
\begin{split}
\braket{\Psi|H|\Psi} 
&= \sum_{i=1}^N\int d^3r \psi_i^*({\bf r}) \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + v_{ext}({\bf r}) \right) \psi_i({\bf r}) \\
+& \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^N\int d^3r d^3r' \frac{e^2}{|r-r'|}
\psi_i^*({\bf r})\psi_i({\bf r})\psi_j^*({\bf r'})\psi_j({\bf r'}) \\
-& \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^N\int d^3r d^3r' \frac{e^2}{|r-r'|}
\psi_i^*({\bf r})\psi_i({\bf r'})\psi_j^*({\bf r'})\psi_j({\bf r}) \\
+& V_{nuc-nuc}
\end{split}
$$

---

* The last term $V_{nuc-nuc}$ is the nuclar-nuclear repulsion term, and the second last term is called **exchange repulsion term**.
* If we minimize the above expression with respect to the $\psi_i^*$ under the constraint of normalization, we have **Hartree-Fock equation**.
$$
\begin{split}
&\left\{ -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 + v_{ext}({\bf r}) + v_H({\bf r}) \right\} \psi_i({\bf r}) \\
& -\sum\int\frac{e^2}{|r-r'|}\psi_j^*({\bf r'})\psi_i({\bf r'})\psi_j({\bf r}) = \epsilon_i \psi_i({\bf r})
\end{split}
$$

## Electron correlation
* The Hartree-Fock method generates solutions to the Schrodinger equation where the real electron-electron interaction is replaced by an average interaction. In a sufficiently large basis set, the HF wave function accounts for ~99% of the total energy, but the remaining 1% is often very important for describing chemical phenomena such as chemical bond formation or breaking.
* The difference in energy between the HF and the lowest possible energy in the given basis set is called the *electron correlation energy*.
* Physically, it corresponds to the motion of the electrons being correlated, i.e. on the average they are further apart than described by the HF wave function.
* The HF method determines the energetically best single-determinant trial wave function (within the given basis set). It is therefore clear that, in order to improve on the HF results, the starting point must be a trial wave function that contains more than one Slater determinant.
* As the HF solution usually gives ~99% of the correct answer, electron correlation methods normally use the HF wave function as a starting point for improvements.

## Density Functional Theory
* A *function* is a prescription for producing a number from a set of *variables*.
* A *functional* is a prescription for producing a number from a *function*, which in turn depends on variables.
* A wave function and the electron density are thus *functions*, while the energy depending on a wave function or an electron density is a *functional*.
* We will denote a function depending on a set of variables ${\bf x}$ with $f({\bf x})$, while a functional depending on a function $f$ is denoted as $F[f]$.

## Orbital-free DFT
* The electronic energy functional of electron density $\rho$ can be divided into three parts; kinetic energy functional $T[\rho]$, the nuclei-electron attraction energy functional $E_{ne}[\rho]$, and the electron-electron repulsion energy functional $E_{ee}[\rho]$.
* With reference to the Hartree-Fock theory, $E_{ee}[\rho]$ may be divided into Coulomb and exchange parts, $J[\rho]$ and $K[\rho]$.
* Among these energy functionals, $E_{ne}[\rho]$ and $J[\rho]$ can be interpreted by the classical electrodynamics, 
$$
E_{ne}[\rho] = -\sum_i^{N_{nuc}}\int\frac{Z_a(R_a)\rho({\bf r})}{|{\bf R}_a - {\bf r}|}d{\bf r} \\
J[\rho] = \frac{1}{2}\int\int\frac{\rho({\bf r})\rho({\bf r'})}{|{\bf r} - {\bf r'}|}d{\bf r}d{\bf r'}
$$

---

* Here, the factor of 1/2 in $J[\rho]$ allows the integration to be done over all space fo both ${\bf r}$ and ${\bf r'}$ variables. Unlike these energy components, exchange part $K[\rho]$ can only be interpreted by the quantum mechanics.
* Early attempts of deducing functionals for the kinetic and exchange energies considered a uniform electrons gas where it may be shown that $T[\rho]$ and $K[\rho]$ are given by
$$
T_{TF}[\rho] = C_F \int \rho^{5/3}({\bf r})d{\bf r} \\
K_D[\rho] = -C_X \int \rho^{4/3}({\bf r})d{\bf r} \\
C_F = \frac{3}{10}(3\pi^2)^{2/3}, \ C_X = \frac{3}{4}\left( \frac{3}{\pi} \right)^{1/3}
$$

* The energy functional $E_{TF}[\rho] = T_{TF}[\rho] + E_{ne}[\rho] + J[\rho]$ is known as *Thomas-Fermi theory*, while including $K_D[\rho]$ exchange part constitutes the *Thomas-Fermi-Dirac model*.
* Since $T[\rho]$ and $K[\rho]$ functionals are depending directly on the electron density, these methods are called *orbital-free DFT*, as opposed to the Kohn-Sham theory discussed in the next section.
* Unfortunately, the accuracy of the orbital-free DFT is too low to be of general use.

---

## Kohn-Sham theory
* The success of modern DFT method is based on the suggestion by Kohn and Sham in 1965 that the electron kinetic energy should be calculated from an auxiliary set of orbitals used for representing the electron density.
* The main drawback in the orbital-free DFT is the poor representation of the kinetic energy, and the idea in the Kohn-Sham formalism is to split the kinetic energy functional into two parts, one which can be calculated exactly, and a small correction term.
* Assume for the moment a Hamiltonian operator of the form with $0 \le \lambda \le 1$.
$$
H_{\lambda} = {\bf T} + {\bf V}_{ext}(\lambda) + \lambda {\bf V}_{ee}
$$

* The external potential operator ${\bf V}_{ext}$ is equal to ${\bf V}_{ee}$ for $\lambda = 1$, but for intermediate $\lambda$ value it is assumed that ${\bf V}_{ext}(\lambda)$ is adjusted such that the same density is obtained for $\lambda = 1$ (the real system), for $\lambda = 0$ (a hypothetical system with non-interaction electrons) and for all intermediate $\lambda$ values.

---

* For the $\lambda = 0$ case, the electrons are non-interacting, and the exact solution to the Schrodinger equation is given as a Slater determinant composed of molecular orbitals $\phi_i$. Then the exact kinetic energy functional is
$$
T_{KS} = \sum_i^{N_{el}}\braket{\phi_i|-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2|\phi_i}
$$

* The $\lambda = 1$ corresponds to interacting electrons, and Eq.X is therefore only an approximation to the real kinetic energy.
* The key to Kohn-Sham theory is to calculate the kinetic energy under the assumption of non-interacting electrons (in the sense that the HF orbitals in the wave function theory).
* In reality, the electrons are interacting, and Eq.X does not provide the total kinetic energy. However, just as HF theory provides ~99% of the correct answer, the difference between the exact kinetic energy and that calculated by assuming non-interacting orbitals is small.
* The remaining kinetic energy is absorbed into an exchange-correlation term, and a general DFT energy expression can be written as
$$
E_{DFT}[\rho] = T_{KS}[\rho] + E_{ne}[\rho] + J[\rho] + E_{XC}[\rho]
$$

* By equating $E_{DFT}$ to the exact energy, the above expression actually defines $E_{XC}$ i.e. it is the part that remains after subtraction of the non-interacting kinetic energy, and $E_{ee}$ and $J$ potential energy terms;
$$
E_{XC}[\rho] = (T[\rho] - T_{KS}[\rho]) + (E_{ee}[\rho] - J[\rho])
$$

---

* The task in developing orbital-free DFT is to derive approximations to the kinetic, exchange, and correlation energy functionals, while the corresponding task in Kohn-Sham theory is to derive approximations to the exchange-correlation energy functional only.
* Since the exchange-correlation energy is roughly a factor of 10 smaller than the kinetic energy, the Kohn-Sham theory is much less sensitive to inaccuracies in the functionals than the orbital-free DFT.
* The division of the electron kinetic energy into two parts, with the major contribution being equivalent to the Hartree-Fock energy, can be justified as follows.

## Gradient methods and molecular property (from Atkins)
* Once the electronic energy is obtained by solving the electronic Schrodinger equation, a number of molecular properties, perhaps the most important being the equilibrium molecular geometry, can be determined.
* The calculation of molecular or crystal structures is a variable supplement to experimental data in areas of structural chemistry such as X-ray crystallography, electron diffreaction, and microwave spectroscopy.
* Calculation of derivatives of the potential energy with respect to nuclar coordinates is crucial to the efficient determination of equilibrium structures.
* The derivatives can be computed numerically by calculating the potential energy at many geometries and determining the chnge in energy as each nuclear coordiate is varied.

---

## Energy derivatives and the Hessian matrix
* For a diatomic molecule, the molecular potential energy $E$ depends only on the internuclar distance $R$; therefore, to find the potential minimum (or in general the energy stationary point) we need to locate a zero in $dE/dR$.
* The search is more cpmplicated for polyatomic molecules because the potential energy is a function of many nuclear coordinates, $q_i$.
* At the equilibrium geometry, each of the forced $f_i$ exerted on a nucleus by electrons and other nuclei must vanish:
$$
f_i = -\frac{\partial E}{\partial q_i} = 0 \ \text{(for all i)}
$$
* Therefore, in principle, the equilibrium geometry can be found by computing all the forces at a given molecular geometry and seeing if they vanish. If the do not, the geometry is varied until one is found that correspond to zero forces.
* A zero gradient characterizes a stationary point on the surface, but does not tell whether it is minima, maxima, or saddle points.
* Therefore, the searching procedure allows us to locate not only an equilibrium geometry of a stable molecule but also the transition state of a chemical reaction, the latter corresponding to a saddle point on the potential energy surface.
* To distinguish the types of stationary points, it is necessary to consider the second derivatives of the energy with respect to the nuclar coordinates.
* The quantities $\partial^2 E/ \partial q_i \partial q_j$ comprise the **Hessian or Hesse matrix**. Whereas a minimum (maximum) of a one-dimensional potential curve corresponds to a positvie (negative) second derivative, a maximum (minimum) of a multi-dimensional potential energy surface is characterized by the eigenvalues of the Hessian all being positive (negative). A transition state (a first-order saddle point) correspond to one negative eigenvalue and all the rest positive.

## Transition state
* The transition state (TS) is a point on the PES connecting the two energy minima.
* A clear example of this is that the bond dissociation or formation process (Fig.X).
* The minimum at right corresponds to the state that has the O-H bond in this example, while the left minimum corresponds to the state with N-H bond.
* There is a saddle point between them, and the activation energy ($E_a$) can be measured by the energy difference between minima and the saddle point.

---

## Activation energy 
* When wa have the $E_a$, we can calculate the rate constant of the chemical reaction by Arrhenius equation as
$$
k = A\exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)
$$
where $A$ is the pre-exponential factor and $R$ is the gas constant.
* $A$ is less dependent to molecular species, but $E_a$ is highly dependent.
* Therefore obtaining the transition state structure is critically important topic in the chemical reaction.
